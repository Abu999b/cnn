### 📑 Abstract

**Title:** ScalpDetectAI - Deep Learning-Based Hair and Scalp Disease Detection

**Abstract:**
This project presents *ScalpDetectAI*, a deep learning-powered web application designed for early detection of scalp and hair diseases. Leveraging a fine-tuned InceptionV3 convolutional neural network, the system classifies uploaded scalp images into 14 dermatological conditions, including alopecia, folliculitis, and more. The application provides instant predictions with confidence scores, coupled with condition-specific information such as symptoms, treatments, and expert advice. Designed for both patients and dermatologists, this tool serves as a scalable AI-assisted pre-diagnostic system accessible through any browser.
